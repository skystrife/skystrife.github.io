<article>
  <p>This is what we’ve come up with for estimating question quality. These are
the key things we wanted in the measure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We don’t want it to be biased toward older or newer questions.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Older questions might end up biased because they’ve been around for
longer, meaning they’ve had more time to accumulate upvotes when
compared to newer questions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Newer questions might end up biased because they were posted at a time
when the community potentially had more active users, meaning they had
a higher likelihood of being observed by more users.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want the measure to be comparable between quarters <em>within a
community</em>, so we can answer questions like “did the quality go up
between Q1 and Q2?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want a normalized measure, so we can compare quality scores <em>between
communities</em>, so we can answer questions like “is the question quality
in this community better than this other one?”</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We arrived at the following. Let’s first try to define an estimate for the
likelihood that a random user who decides to take at least one <em>active</em>
action on question $q$ would eventually go on to upvote it. The assumption
here is that high quality questions would have a higher probability of this
event. We can estimate the probability as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(v_{\uparrow} \mid q)
    \approx \frac{c(v_{\uparrow}, q) + \alpha}
                 {|\{ u \in U \mid u \text{ acted on } q\}| + \alpha + \beta}</script>

<p>where $v_{\uparrow}$ represents an upvote, $c(v_{\uparrow}, q)$ is the
number of upvotes $q$ received, $U$ is the set of all users in this
community, and “acted on” is defined as having voted on, commented on, or
answered a question. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the hyperparameters of a Beta
prior on this probability so we can smooth away bad estimates from
questions that have very little activity.</p>

<p>This is also equivalent to saying</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(v_{\uparrow} \mid q) \approx
  \frac{n}{n+n_0} \hat{\theta} + \frac{n_0}{n + n_0} \theta_0</script>

<p>where $n = |\{u \in U \mid u \text{ acted on } q\}|$, $n_0$ is the number
of “pseudo-users” that acted on $q$, and $\hat{\theta}$ and $\theta_0$ are
the MLE and prior estimates for the upvote probability, respectively.</p>

<p>We are planning on estimating $\theta_0$ based on the average number of
upvotes relative to the number of users who acted on a question across all
questions in all Stack Exchanges we have, and then setting $n_0$ to some
reasonable value for smoothing the actual probability estimates. (Is this
cheating? If so, we could exclude the current community from our estimate
for $\theta_0$.)</p>

<p>We can also estimate an equivalent $P(v_{\downarrow} \mid q)$ for the
probability of receiving a downvote, and our overall quality score can then
be</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">s(q) = P(v_{\uparrow} \mid q) - P(v_{\downarrow} \mid q)</script>

<p>which is bounded between $[-1, 1]$, can be compared within a community
across time periods, and can be compared between communities.</p>
